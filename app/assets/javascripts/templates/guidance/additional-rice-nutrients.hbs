<p class="text -plain-text">
  When rice fields are flooded, anaerobic decomposition (in other words,
  decomposition in the absence of oxygen) of organic material takes place.
  A byproduct of this anaerobic decomposition is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a greenhouse
  gas. The CH<sub>4</sub> is released into the atmosphere through the rice plants.

<p class="text -plain-text">
  The application of rice straw and the timing of this application, as well
  as the application of compost, farm yard manure, and manure, also has an
  impact on the methane emissions resulting from flooding. The organic material
  from these applications will lead to greater CH<sub>4</sub> emissions.
