<h3 class="text -help-title">Tillage practice</h3>

<p class="text -plain-text">
  On this page you are asked to provide your tillage practices. The type
  of tillage practice has an impact on soil carbon content. Intensive tillage
  practices lead to lower carbon contents in the soil than low intensive or no
  tillage systems. If tillage practice changes from scenario 1 to scenario 2,
  it could lead to either emissions or removals of atmospheric carbon dioxide
  depending on the change adopted.

The tillage options are defined by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines<sup>1</sup> as the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No tillage</strong> – Direct seeding without primary tillage, with only minimal soil
    disturbance in the seeding zone. Herbicides typically used for weed control.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Minimal/shallow till</strong> - Primary and/or secondary tillage but with reduced
    soil disturbance (usually shallow and without full soil inversion). Normally
    leaves surface with >30% coverage by residues at planting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Full tillage</strong> - Substantial soil disturbance with full inversion and/or frequent
   (within year) tillage operations. At planting time, little (e.g., <30%) of the
   surface is covered by residues.
  </li>
</ul>
